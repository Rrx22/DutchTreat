My first Web App using ASP.NET core, for educational purposes. Built it from the ground up.
Check it out at: http://dutchtreatpagina.azurewebsites.net/

I already knew C#, HTML, CSS, JS. However for this project I used new technologies:
- Bootstrap
- TypeScript
- Angular
- Azure Website
- Azure SQL
- ASP.NET Core, building an API
- Entity Net Core, creating a database.
